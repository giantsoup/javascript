# Javascript
General site for creating and testing javascript.

## Install
To install this site locally or on a server you will have to have php, node and npm installed.

1. Clone repo to desired location.
2. Run `npm install` in the directory.
3. Run `npm run dev` in the directory. If on a production server run `npm run prod` instead to fully minify assets.

After that you can navigate to the website and everything should be working correctly. I am using the latest versions of node and npm so if you get errors while trying to run `npm install` you might have to upgrade one or both of them.
